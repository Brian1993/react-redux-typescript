## React-Redux-TypesSript
  Integrate React with Redux and TypesSript
  
## Review
  React and Redux are librarys toward to functional programming. So it has its pros and cons to integrate with TypeScript
  
  Pros:
  
    1. Use Interface replace comments as documentation
    2. Strong type bring robust code
    3. Easy to debug
  
  Cons: 
 
    1. Strong type takes out the nature of javascript. Most of the javascript developer use a 
    lot of trusey and falsey characteristic of javascript to write flexible code. But with TypeScript, 
    it dosen't work that way. Everything has a type.
    2. Some of the librarys don't have great type definition file which can cause a lot of headaches.
